you &apos;re all alone .
they approve .
we &apos;re ready to leave .
I can drive to Boston and back on one t@@ ank of gas .
why don &apos;t you pull over ?
why don &apos;t you meet me out front in a few minutes ?
Sami feels so scared .

does your dog bite ?
I just wanted to see what would happen .
brea@@ the , dam@@ n you !
what he said made us angry .
I &apos;ll wait for you in my room .

I didn &apos;t see Tom yesterday .
we still have a few weeks left .

where are your friends going ?
as the door slid open , he almost fell onto the plat@@ form .
can you use a computer ?
that &apos;s a lot of cash .
he &apos;s not a bad person .
if I tell him the truth , she will never forgive me .
you should have seen her .
some day we &apos;ll take a trip to India .

Tom &apos;s eyes were full of tears .
what is today &apos;s date ?
I &apos;ve missed you so much , Tom .

I just inv@@ ented a new word @-@ pro@@ c@@ es@@ sor en@@ ab@@ ling to pronounce them back@@ wards .
the old man started to laugh s@@ ad@@ ly .
I &apos;m appl@@ ying for a job .

do you think it was easy for me ?
I scre@@ am@@ ed but nobody could hear me .
can anyone drive ?
I am very ill at ease with strangers .
do you want me to tell Tom that we won &apos;t do that ?
two weeks have passed and I haven &apos;t seen you .
don &apos;t look !
why don &apos;t you love me ?
Tom wants to buy a b@@ ass guitar , but he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
I cannot put up with her behav@@ ior .
any of you can do it .
I remember what I saw .
they admitted that they &apos;d lied .
I don &apos;t like swimming in po@@ ols .
can you understand the meaning of this sentence ?
the man was hiding in a den@@ se for@@ est .
I know that this is weird .
that would make sense .
no one had seen anything .
I have no si@@ bl@@ ings .
what &apos;s the gold@@ en rule ?
he can hardly speak any English .
I had my watch m@@ ended .
we can help you .
are you involved in politi@@ cs ?
b@@ low out the cand@@ les .
I wasn &apos;t entirely sure myself .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
it was a beautiful night .
I think you made the right choice .
the truth is I told a lie .
Tom has the experience necessary .
how do you stop this ?
you have too many ir@@ ons in the fire .
but it &apos;s me who should thank you .
he came while I was still asleep .
I took over the business from F@@ a@@ ther .
oil is expensive .
where did Tom buy it ?
I bought a house .
do you know who we are ?
it &apos;s as old as the world .
Dan ann@@ oun@@ ced that he and Linda were getting divor@@ ced .
I have a vis@@ a .
it will be a great pleasure for me to translate the story and to read it to you .
what &apos;s with the luggage ?
something is asked of me .
it &apos;s like being a kid in a candy store .
M@@ ath@@ s is a good subject .
you really speak French well .
for exam@@ ple , more people are cho@@ o@@ sing to live together and have children without getting married .
are you seriously thinking about going ?
it was a pleasure meeting you , Tom .
if you don &apos;t eat , you &apos;ll die .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t have the right e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment .
I ran outside and the door locked itself behind me .
it would be coun@@ ter @-@ productive to do such a thing .
what do you want ?
I &apos;m waiting impati@@ ently .
S@@ p@@ ino@@ z@@ a was a pan@@ the@@ ist .
I like both science and math .
we &apos;re not certain of that yet .
I know it &apos;s not impossible .
I work in the morning .
Tom has reques@@ ted my assist@@ ance .
do you want to get us both killed ?
they all speak French .
why are you so good at explain@@ ing things ?
no one will stop me .
I &apos;m a trai@@ ne@@ e .
how much are you being paid to do this ?
she was loved by everybody in the village .
where do you train your students ?
have you seen my camera ?
I hear you were gr@@ ounded .
this book is too large to go in my pocket .
could you please over@@ look it this time ?
when I was your age , I had a boyfriend .
I hate that guy .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
he borrowed the car from his friend .
this TV was made in China .
I feel sick every morning .
you should know yourself .
he took this photo .
would you like to read this magazine ?
he took charge of the firm after his father &apos;s death .
Tom and I usually talked to each other in French .
I filled up the vase with water .
it doesn &apos;t matter who says that , it &apos;s not true .
this is how I made it .
do you know how to play chess ?
this bicycle is mine . yours is over there .
it &apos;s an em@@ er@@ gency !
for me , the real world is just a fic@@ tion .
speaking of films , why not go to the cinema tonight ?
Tom felt his phone vi@@ br@@ ate .
will it be fine tomorrow ?
I never really gave it much thought .
Tom likes living in Boston .
anything you want , my dear .
she attr@@ acted me at first sight .
that is the fun@@ ni@@ est joke that I have ever heard .
he promised to pro@@ vide information .
I &apos;m taking care of it . you can rel@@ ax . you can rely on me .
are you still sick ?
I &apos;ve just spoken to your French teacher and he says you &apos;re doing well in his class .
everybody &apos;s in a hurry these days .
she likes to go to the library .
everyone is waiting in the other room .
it matters to me .
the cold air re@@ viv@@ ed Tom .
are you out of your mind ?
she tempted him .
everyone can make a difference in their own lives and ther@@ e@@ by collec@@ ti@@ vely make the world a better place for themselves and others around them .
you &apos;re not in a hurry , are you ?
let &apos;s come back to it later .
I should talk to Tom .
you &apos;d better stay with me .
once upon a time there lived an em@@ per@@ or who was a great con@@ qu@@ er@@ or , and re@@ ig@@ ned over more countries than anyone in the world .
can you come to the party ?
don &apos;t s@@ plash me !
Tom hardly spoke any French when I first met him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .
there &apos;s only one pretty child in the world , and every mother has it .
J@@ ac@@ ques made it clear that he wanted to meet Mr G@@ ag@@ non .
everyone is free to contribu@@ te .
Tom was mu@@ gg@@ ed on his way home from work .
they made sure nobody could see them .
a guy nearly ran into us .
I think we have some un@@ finished business .
I &apos;ve lost my f@@ illing .
do you think that &apos;s true ?
if you would be a good read@@ er , read ; if a writer , write .
I hate those spi@@ ders . they &apos;re always there to fre@@ a@@ k me out when I &apos;m clean@@ ing .
no such person exi@@ sts .
do your best !
I gave up hope .
she advised him to cut down on smoking .
no matter how much I think about it , I can &apos;t understand it .
she told him a joke .
can you put the children to bed ?
Marie &apos;s hiding something from me .
did you go to Tom &apos;s party last S@@ at@@ urday ?
he wrote a novel bas@@ ed on anci@@ ent my@@ ths .
Tom went rock clim@@ b@@ ing .
she didn &apos;t like this game .
they &apos;ve known each other for a very long time .
don &apos;t touch this !
you &apos;ve been warned .
he plays the piano very well .
what makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto@@ le your bicycle ?
she has good ide@@ as .
what a horrible thing !
we have no choice but to give up the whole plan .
you &apos;re a trai@@ tor .
we take risks all the time .
Z@@ ail@@ ai@@ b@@ a bar is hi@@ ring wai@@ ters ; are you interested ?
I can &apos;t li@@ ft my right arm .
I tried flying from the top of the tree .
this pri@@ est is a good man .
I sometimes lie on the gr@@ ass .
Tom thought Mary was safe .
I just want to know why you brought me here .
open the door .
it &apos;s almost hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ago .
we assume that he is honest .
are you all right ?
whichever road you may take , it will lead to the station .
if I were you , I &apos;d buy that one .
he makes himself acc@@ es@@ sible to all who see@@ k his coun@@ sel .
I &apos;m sorry I misunder@@ stood you .
where can I find a taxi ?
she &apos;s going through a mid@@ life crisis .
the rescued refu@@ ge@@ es were long@@ ing for free@@ dom .
stop suc@@ king up to the teacher .
repe@@ at@@ e@@ dly s@@ lam@@ ming the clu@@ t@@ ch pe@@ d@@ al , I some@@ how managed to get the clu@@ t@@ ch dis@@ engag@@ ed so I could just about drive for the time being .
they did not believe me .
we know you &apos;re interested .
the house is bur@@ ning !
we consider Tom honest .
I &apos;ll give you a simple exam@@ ple .
winds from the sea are mo@@ ist .
we have arrived safe and sound .
we are going to leave tomorrow .
Mr W@@ il@@ son is proud of his house .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
the meeting will be held regard@@ less of the weather .
in the Ar@@ c@@ tic there are no pen@@ gu@@ ins .
she &apos;s young , naive and in@@ experi@@ enced .
