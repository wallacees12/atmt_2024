today is a new day !
I want you to get started right away .
do you see the six windows on the fac@@ ade ?
one should be respec@@ t@@ ful of other &apos;s beli@@ e@@ fs rather than mo@@ ck them .
people usually die if you kill them .
it was working .
Tom needs us to show him the way .
just do your job .
the train was about to leave the station .
here is an atom@@ ic power plant .
when the al@@ arm clock goes off , I don &apos;t move .
this feels like sil@@ k .
a traffic accident happened there .
Tom didn &apos;t do that very much .
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sentence , forever , disappear@@ ed our Mary .
we im@@ port coffee from Brazil .
but you cannot understand . how could you understand what it is to feel old ?
why do I believe you ?
you spread your affai@@ rs too th@@ in .
those box spea@@ kers have a good re@@ ver@@ b .
they were hanging on her words .
instead of complaining , maybe you should help .
I think we can handle that .
I am deeply interested in art .
you are old enough to know this .
I accepted his invit@@ ation .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing your new song .
the children are going to the beach today .
can you believe this is really happening ?
he paid the loan with interest .
I know you like chocolate .
I never meant for any of this to happen .
the de@@ er was running by itself .
for him , divorce is a good invention , with one so@@ le dis@@ advantage : you have to get married first .
the bi@@ parti@@ san comm@@ ission &apos;s recomm@@ end@@ ations were ignored .
I wasn &apos;t told where we were going .
that &apos;s doub@@ t@@ ful .
she intended to become an ac@@ tr@@ ess .
he is always expres@@ sion@@ less .
he has travel@@ ed around the world in eigh@@ ty days by himself .
blame it on the weather .
I can explain it to you , but I can &apos;t understand it for you !

he left the room without saying a word .
I &apos;d like to get medic@@ al insurance .
he went down the h@@ ill .
the girls gi@@ ggl@@ ed .
is anybody there ?
I &apos;m not scared of women .
the angry mo@@ b over@@ turned cars and smashed sto@@ re@@ front windows .
I res@@ ign .
I know he is busy .
the man and his horse that fell off the cli@@ ff were soon rescued .
she is very c@@ un@@ ning .
it was a com@@ promise .
he is ap@@ t to forget .
a bird in the hand is better than two in the bus@@ h .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
turn right at the next inter@@ section .
you look busy .
they all laughed at their error .
Tom didn &apos;t eat the apple you gave him .
birds have n@@ ests , spi@@ ders have we@@ bs , and hum@@ ans have friendship .
ten years have gone by .
I &apos;m trapped .
Marie rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ antly takes another piece of cake .
I left behind some important docu@@ ments for the company at home . sorry , but could you please go and get them for me now ?
&quot; listen to me , &quot; said the D@@ em@@ on , plac@@ ing his hand upon my head .
you should have stopped .
he spr@@ ained his ank@@ le .
Tom looks older than he really is .
I was watching the scene ho@@ l@@ ding my breath .
Mary got to know her boyfriend in Paris .
hand in your pap@@ ers .
are you still married ?
you must pay in adv@@ ance .
in K@@ aby@@ li@@ a , we speak the K@@ aby@@ le language .
she turned a page of her book .
yes , you should wear red lip@@ stick for V@@ alent@@ ine &apos;s day .
Tom isn &apos;t invited to parties often .
you see the words that I ty@@ ped on the scre@@ en , but you don &apos;t see the tears that I shed over the key@@ board .
give me a ti@@ p .
what do you want to drink with your meal ?
she lives near the beach .
I want to live in a cas@@ tle .

I don &apos;t date .
be respec@@ t@@ ful .
he can swim fast .
he saw a pretty girl .
the windows were open .
Tom wanted to go home early .
I forgot my de@@ bit card at home .
you &apos;re tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
Mary threw a po@@ ta@@ to through the window .
everyone deserves a second chance .
I find that it &apos;s best to find a happy bal@@ ance between origin@@ ality and sti@@ cking to a strict stand@@ ard .
I remember meeting her somewhere .
I &apos;m br@@ in@@ ging home a pizza .
here is where it all happens .
soon your efforts will be rewar@@ ded .
is the coffee hot ?
thanks for jo@@ in@@ ing us .
it &apos;s a p@@ ity that you can &apos;t travel with us .
I wonder what happened to Paul .
you know where to find me if you need anything .
no one knows his name .
I &apos;m on to you .
it &apos;s b@@ lowing very hard .
I didn &apos;t know you were still here .
we talked about everything we could think about .
I don &apos;t have much time .
don &apos;t you feel stupid now ?
Tom &apos;s phone can take pictures .
what do you want the message to be ?
mom said I caught a cold because I went out with wet hair .
how many more for@@ ks do you need ?
rarely have I met such a gr@@ ac@@ eful d@@ anc@@ er .
I &apos;ve missed another chance .
I don &apos;t know how to contact you .
do you want to join me for lunch ?
all of these letters are addressed to you .
Tom knew where he had put his keys .
you could count to ten when you were two .
I just found it .
Tom is laughing .
do you know what day it is today ?
the poor cat was run over by a truck .
I don &apos;t want to get involved in that business .
there isn &apos;t any problem at all .
I was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
the boy was clever enough to solve the puzzle .
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine .
I appreciate your work .
the system is ri@@ gg@@ ed .
an arti@@ st must have an eye for col@@ our .
Oh wo@@ w ! what &apos;s this , you &apos;re having lunch without me !
you sound tired .
maybe Tom is in love .
look at the met@@ er .
Thomas changed into proper clo@@ thing .
my mother bought two bottles of orange ju@@ ice .
taking everything into consi@@ der@@ ation , the result is better than I expected .
I guess right nine times out of ten .
that &apos;s a nice pair of legs .
it is by this reason that he left school .
&quot; have you finished ? &quot; &quot; on the contrary . I haven &apos;t even started . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t like beef . neither do I .
where did you go to school ?
please don &apos;t dis@@ tr@@ act me from my work .
by teaching , we learn .
I tell you a little secret .
I &apos;m not scared at all .
he was ac@@ comp@@ an@@ i@@ ed by his girlfriend .
his office is near the train station .
Tom was sitting under a tree , drinking wine .
I &apos;ve been hoping to meet you .
don &apos;t work too hard !
can you wash my jeans ?
do you speak Mal@@ t@@ ese ?
I &apos;m as curi@@ ous as you are .
Oh , how we laughed !
what &apos;s your occup@@ ation ?
that picture does not do justice to him .
don &apos;t cut in while we &apos;re talking .
it &apos;s because I was asked to come that I &apos;m here .
I really wish I could go with you , but I can &apos;t .
he is wise who neither ho@@ pes nor fe@@ ars anything from the un@@ certain future .
our class has twenty @-@ five boys and twenty girls .
go away before they see you here .
I &apos;m with them now .
once I reti@@ re , I will de@@ dic@@ ate my whole time to Tatoeba .
it &apos;s mer@@ ely a joke .
I do not have a sister .
S@@ am is two years younger than Tom .
may I borrow your bike ?
what does your father like ?
what a cat@@ as@@ trop@@ he !
for the shar@@ ks , we saw them , not by un@@ its , nor by ten@@ s , nor by hun@@ dre@@ ds ; but by thousands and by my@@ ri@@ ad@@ s . trust me , there are more shar@@ ks in the sea than mor@@ tal@@ s on land .
you should get up early .
love is terri@@ fied of everything that is not itself .
he &apos;ll be back in ten .
if I wanted to s@@ care you , I would have told you about what I dream@@ t about a few weeks ago .
you &apos;re not dead yet .
I know a good restaurant that &apos;s in@@ expensive .
who is the person in charge ?
trying to find happiness only makes you un@@ happy .
I want to speak to a lawyer .
he av@@ eng@@ ed his dead father .
she liked that .
I &apos;m so@@ re all over .
why don &apos;t you sit down ?
stop sho@@ wing off !
the weather is very cold in I@@ stanbul .
I &apos;m doing you a fav@@ or .
you were afraid , weren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t like the taste of on@@ ions .
they never returned to their country .
when do you mean to start ?
why do the stars tw@@ in@@ k@@ le ?
when I came home , he was watching TV .
she nam@@ ed him Charles .
she sang better than him .
I made a proposal .
what do you plan on doing tonight ?
I &apos;m afraid you can &apos;t do that .
there is milk in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
I don &apos;t know her address .
I don &apos;t blame you for doing that .
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto .
I think you &apos;re too pick@@ y .
I opened the window to let in some fres@@ h air .
I could not stop laughing .
press any key to contin@@ ue .
I &apos;m not rac@@ ist .

call me if you want to do something together tomorrow .
at what time are we going to get a bite to eat , with all that ?
who &apos;s your most interesting friend ?

Mi@@ sunder@@ stand@@ ings do occur .
are you going to be OK ?
what &apos;s going on with you ? you haven &apos;t been talking to me for a while now .
